M-RTorres additions:

If anyone wants to tweak any of these animations, it is welcomed, I am not too confident on my skills.

Fully original animations:
	j_sock_and_buskin: Nothing to add.
	v_magic_trick: Nothing to add.
	j_superposition: Needs on trigger logic (something like, if in row 0, set target to 5, else set target to 0).
	j_oops: Done the background, but it needs a 3/5 frame animation of the dice rolling when triggered.

Just recolors of Chloe's basic jocker animation:
	j_jolly: Nothing to add.
	j_zany: Nothing to add.
    j_mad: Nothing to add.
    j_crazy: Nothing to add.
    j_droll: Nothing to add.
    j_half: Nothing to add.
    j_steel_joker: Nothing to add.
    j_golden: Nothing to add.
    j_green_joker: Nothing to add.
    j_hologram: animated, but I didn't know how to implement it.
    j_glass: Nothing to add.
    j_cartomancer: Nothing to add.

Recolors of Chloe's basic jocker animation with minimal tweaks:
	j_stencil: deformed the wrinkles as the joker moves.
	J_marble: Addapted to broken hat.
	j_even_steven: Addapted to even hat.
	j_odd_todd: Addapted to odd hat.
	j_stone: Had to figure out colors for the cracked parts.
	J_mr_bones: Adapted to skull laugh. I read it was studied adding a destroy animation, it should be an extra layer with the first frame fully transparent, and the rest should totally cover the card, overwriting the laugh. 



Recolors of Chloe's basic jocker with even less animation than the original:
	j_baron: Nothing to add.
	j_luchador: Adapted the eyes, but that is not much.
	j_fortune_teller: Nothing to add.
	j_swashbuckler: Made the scarf move with the hatm but that is not much.
	j_showman: Nothing to add.
	j_matador: Nothing to add.
	j_stuntman: Nothing to add.
	

Recolors of Chloe's basic jocker with animated additions:
	j_sly: Animated the new hat.
	j_wily: Just a recolor of sly joker.
	j_clever: Just a recolor of sly joker.
	j_devious: Just a recolor of sly joker.
	j_crafty: Just a recolor of sly joker.
	j_chaos: Animated the hair lagging behind.
	j_runner: Added running movement and animated the number sign.
	j_blue_joker: Animated the weird hat.
	j_hiker: Animated the walking sticks and metal cup moving with the laugh.
	j_throwback: Separated the background from the joker.

Already animated jokers modified to add Chloe's basic jocker laugh:
	j_greedy_joker: Separated background from the joker, the joker is just a recolor.
    j_lusty_joker: Separated background from the joker, the joker is just a recolor.
    j_wrathful_joker: Separated background from the joker, the joker is just a recolor.
    j_gluttenous_joker: Separated background from the joker, the joker is just a recolor.
    j_scholar: Separated the joker from the drawn (A+), animated the hats ribbon, the (A+) is transparent to emulate the other shade of red on top of the hat of the original.
    j_space: Separated background from the joker, the joker animation is adapted to the helmet.
    j_blackboard: Separated the joker from the eraser and chalk, on the extra layer there is also a mask with the erased background that covers the joker as it is erased. The original animation logic needs to be transferred from the original layer to the extra one. There is a weird black outline around the mask, so the effect is very noticeable, I don’t know if it can be fixed.
    j_sixth_sense: The only one I feel I am overwriting the original animator intent, but it felt wrong having all the jokers laugh except this one. the closing and closed eye sprites are from the original animation.
    j_constelation: Added 6 frames to fit the laugh while the joker is visible and sifted the animation, so it is sync up with the rest of the laughs.
    j_vampire: Separated the joker from the dripping blood animation.
	j_astronomer: Separated background from the joker, the joker is just a recolor, but to make it both float and laugh, it has 330 frames.

Jokers that I have not done due to limitations, but that I would like to:
	j_burglar: I don’t fully understand the trigger condition, but anyway, I tried to make the darkness an extra layer, but I couldn't make the eyes be seen through it
	j_blueprint: I wanted to make the joker laugh while open, but if wanted it to not show while closed, I would need very complex animation logic (that would not be sync up with the rest) or the solution detailed below
	j_invisible: I can make the three different stages laugh without problem, but there would be no in between transitions, it would be fixed with the solution detailed below
	j_brainstorm: The exact same problem that blueprint.

	All four jokers above would be possible with the following solution:
		A system of bidimensional animations, I mean, having a sprite sheet where the x axis and the y axis control the state of different animations with their own logic and sprite shown is the intersection of both.

		The way I would implement it is the following:
			Inside the animation parameters, having another subdictionary like extra called animated_rows (or something like that) with its own frames (called rows or something like that), rows per frame, target, etc.; if there is something inside this subdictionary, set the main animation frames to the frames_per_row value; the logic behind would be identical to the regular frame logic, but changing the start frame instead of the current frame (not sure how the code handles changing the start frame, maybe the current frame should be changed by adding the new start frame and subtracting the previous one)

	j_burnt: I am not good enough to animate the fire.


Doubts I have:
	After seeing this mod conflicted with another mod that changed some jokers and all planets, I decided to combine this mod animations with that mod designs. For most of them, it was as easy as overwriting the atlas; but the ones with extra layer gived me trouble. what is the syntaxis to change the extra layer atlas?
	also, is there any way of changing the amount of frames of an animation with a mod executed after this one?
