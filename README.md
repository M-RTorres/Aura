# Aura
Aura is a mod that seeks to add animations to every Joker in Balatro.

**23/150** Jokers completed

Known Bugs:
- Pixel Smoothing causes the border in Castle to look wonky
- Rerolling while having a duplicated Flash Card (via Invisible Joker/Ankh) will crash the game
- Some animated jokers will have frames flash when they spawn (Flash Card, will find more maybe later)

Artists and progress for each Joker are detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGBtcHmb2hb9bE-ueEiKwMdn3c27fzgU46PYq8b6UhM/edit#gid=0).
